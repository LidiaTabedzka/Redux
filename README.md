# Redux
Task within Kodilla bootcamp. The aim was to use Redux in my projects for the first time.

It is a simple comments app created using React and Redux (creating store, actions and reducers).

The user can add a new comment, edit it or delete it. The user can also vote with thumb-up or thumb-down on the comment.
